"""
Code Analyser GUI Package

This package provides a unified graphical user interface for analysing Python source files
via static code metrics collected from multiple tools, including:

- AST: Analyses abstract syntax tree structure
- Bandit: Detects security issues
- Flake8: Linting and style checks
- Cloc: Counts lines of code, comments, and blank lines
- Lizard: Measures cyclomatic complexity and function length
- Pylint: Reports coding standard violations and maintainability issues
- Pydocstyle: Checks docstring conventions
- Pyflakes: Identifies syntax errors and undefined variables

Modules:
- main.py: Launches the application with a splash screen and full initialisation of all UI components.
- gui_components.py: Builds and manages the main Tkinter interface with tabbed navigation and layout.
- gui_logic.py: Updates the Treeview structure, visual summaries, and chart refresh logic.
- file_ops.py: Coordinates metric collection, file/directory analysis, and CSV/image export.
- chart_utils.py: Responsible for rendering and formatting interactive charts with Matplotlib.
- shared_state.py: Defines and shares Tkinter variables and GUI state across the application.
