# ‚úÖ Best Practice: Use of classifiers helps in categorizing the package for users and tools.

classifiers = [
    "Development Status :: 3 - Alpha",
    "Intended Audience :: Financial and Insurance Industry",
    "Programming Language :: Python",
    "Operating System :: OS Independent",
    "Natural Language :: English",
    "License :: OSI Approved :: GNU Lesser General Public License v3 or later (LGPLv3+)",
]
# ‚úÖ Best Practice: Using path.abspath and path.dirname ensures compatibility across different operating systems.

# read the contents of your README file
# ‚ö†Ô∏è SAST Risk (Low): Opening files without exception handling can lead to unhandled exceptions if the file is missing.
# üß† ML Signal: Keywords help in improving the discoverability of the package.
# ‚úÖ Best Practice: Specifying packages ensures that the correct modules are included in the distribution.
# ‚úÖ Best Practice: Specifying install_requires ensures that dependencies are installed automatically.
# üß† ML Signal: Reading a README file for long_description is a common pattern in Python package setup.
# üß† ML Signal: Package metadata like name and version are crucial for package management and distribution.
# ‚úÖ Best Practice: Including license_files helps users understand the licensing terms.
