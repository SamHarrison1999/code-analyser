import unittest
# ✅ Best Practice: Inheriting from unittest.TestCase to create a test case class
# 🧠 ML Signal: Importing specific modules from a package can indicate which functionalities are frequently used
import tushare.stock.billboard as fd

# ✅ Best Practice: Consider using a more descriptive method name, like `initialize_data`.

    def set_data(self):
        # 🧠 ML Signal: Method name suggests this is a test function, indicating a testing pattern
        # ✅ Best Practice: Use a date format that is clear and unambiguous, such as ISO 8601.

    # ✅ Best Practice: Consider defining constants for magic numbers to improve readability.
    # 🧠 ML Signal: Method name suggests a test function, useful for identifying test patterns

        # 🧠 ML Signal: Method call pattern, useful for understanding object behavior

    # ✅ Best Practice: Consider adding a docstring to describe the purpose and behavior of the test function.

        # ✅ Best Practice: Consider using a logging framework instead of print for better control over output.

        # 🧠 ML Signal: Method definition within a class, indicating object-oriented design

    # 🧠 ML Signal: Usage of a method from an external module or class, indicating a dependency or integration point.
        
    # 🧠 ML Signal: Method call on self, indicating instance method usage

    # ✅ Best Practice: Use the standard unittest framework entry point
    # 🧠 ML Signal: Use of unittest.main() for test execution
    # 🧠 ML Signal: Function call with external dependency (fd), indicating integration with other modules
