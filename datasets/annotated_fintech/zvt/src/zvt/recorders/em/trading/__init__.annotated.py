# ‚úÖ Best Practice: Explicitly importing specific items from a module improves readability and maintainability.


# ‚ö†Ô∏è SAST Risk (Medium): Using wildcard imports can lead to namespace collisions and make it unclear which names are present in the namespace.
# ‚úÖ Best Practice: Using a specific alias for imported items helps avoid naming conflicts and improves code clarity.
# üß† ML Signal: Modifying the __all__ variable indicates dynamic control over module exports, which can be a pattern for ML models to learn about module interface management.
# the __all__ is generated

# __init__.py structure:
# common code of the package
# export interface in __all__ which contains __all__ of its sub modules

# import all from submodule em_dragon_and_tiger_recorder

from .em_dragon_and_tiger_recorder import __all__ as _em_dragon_and_tiger_recorder_all
