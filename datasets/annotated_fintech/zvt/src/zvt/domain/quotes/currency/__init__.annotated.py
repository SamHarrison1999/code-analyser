# ‚úÖ Best Practice: Explicitly importing specific items from a module improves readability and maintainability.


# ‚ö†Ô∏è SAST Risk (Medium): Using wildcard imports can lead to namespace pollution and make it unclear which names are present.
# ‚úÖ Best Practice: Using a specific alias for imported items helps avoid naming conflicts and improves code clarity.
