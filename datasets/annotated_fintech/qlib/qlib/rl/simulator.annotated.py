    """
    Simulator that resets with ``__init__``, and transits with ``step(action)``.

    To make the data-flow clear, we make the following restrictions to Simulator:

    1. The only way to modify the inner status of a simulator is by using ``step(action)``.
    2. External modules can *read* the status of a simulator by using ``simulator.get_state()``,
       and check whether the simulator is in the ending state by calling ``simulator.done()``.

    A simulator is defined to be bounded with three types:

    - *InitialStateType* that is the type of the data used to create the simulator.
    # âœ… Best Practice: Use of type hinting for class attributes improves code readability and maintainability.
    - *StateType* that is the type of the **status** (state) of the simulator.
    # ðŸ§  ML Signal: Constructor method with flexible arguments, indicating potential use of dynamic or configurable initialization
    - *ActType* that is the type of the **action**, which is the input received in each step.

    Different simulators might share the same StateType. For example, when they are dealing with the same task,
    # âœ… Best Practice: Type hinting for parameters and return value improves code readability and maintainability.
    but with different simulation implementation. With the same type, they can safely share other components in the MDP.

    Simulators are ephemeral. The lifecycle of a simulator starts with an initial state, and ends with the trajectory.
    In another word, when the trajectory ends, simulator is recycled.
    If simulators want to share context between (e.g., for speed-up purposes),
    # âœ… Best Practice: Method signature includes type hint for return value
    this could be done by accessing the weak reference of environment wrapper.
    # âœ… Best Practice: Using NotImplementedError in abstract methods indicates that subclasses should implement this method.
