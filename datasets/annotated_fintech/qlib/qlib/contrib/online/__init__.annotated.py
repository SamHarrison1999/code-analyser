# üß† ML Signal: The presence of a method signature for `get_data_with_date` suggests a pattern for data retrieval based on a specific date, which can be used to train models on time-series data.
# ‚úÖ Best Practice: Including a TODO comment indicates a planned feature or enhancement, which is a good practice for tracking development tasks.
# ‚úÖ Best Practice: The method docstring provides a clear explanation of the method's purpose, parameters, and return value, which enhances code readability and maintainability.
# ‚ö†Ô∏è SAST Risk (Low): The use of `raise NotImplementedError` is a common pattern for abstract methods, but it should be implemented to avoid runtime errors.
