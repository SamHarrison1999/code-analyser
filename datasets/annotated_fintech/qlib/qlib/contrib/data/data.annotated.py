# We remove arctic from core framework of Qlib to contrib due to
# - Arctic has very strict limitation on pandas and numpy version
#    - https://github.com/man-group/arctic/pull/908
# - pip fail to computing the right version number!!!!
#    - Maybe we can solve this problem by poetry
# ‚ö†Ô∏è SAST Risk (Low): Using a mutable default value for market_transaction_time_list can lead to unexpected behavior if modified.
