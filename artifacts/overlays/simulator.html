class Simulator(Generic[InitialStateType, StateType, ActType]):
    """
    Simulator that resets with ``__init__``, and transits with ``step(action)``.

    To make the data-flow clear, we make the following restrictions to Simulator:

    1. The only way to modify the inner status of a simulator is by using ``step(action)``.
    2. External modules can *read* the status of a simulator by using ``simulator.get_state()``,
       and check whether the simulator is in the ending state by calling ``simulator.done()``.

    A simulator is defined to be bounded with three types:

    - *InitialStateType* that is the type of the data used to create the simulator.
    - *StateType* that is the type of the **status** (state) of the simulator.
    - *ActType* that is the type of the **action**, which is the input received in each step.

    Different simulators might share the same StateType. For example, when they are dealing with the same task,
    but with different simulation implementation. With the same type, they can safely share other components in the MDP.

    Simulators are ephemeral. The lifecycle of a simulator starts with an initial state, and ends with the trajectory.
    In another word, when the trajectory ends, simulator is recycled.
    If simulators want to share context between (e.g., for speed-up purposes),
    this could be done by accessing the weak reference of environment wrapper.

    Attributes
    ----------
    env
        A reference of env-wrapper, which could be useful in some corner cases.
        Simulators are discouraged to use this, because it's prone to induce errors.
